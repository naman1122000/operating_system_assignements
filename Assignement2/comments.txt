I am storing all the variables required in my_heapinfo() in the 4kb space,  byte number 8-12 from start of 4kb space stores maxsize, 12-16 stores current size, 16-20 freememory, 20-24 number of blocks allocated, 24-28 stores size of max_chunk, 28-32 stores size of smallest chunk, During the call to my_init I initialised all these information. For each my_alloc and my_free call i am updating current size, free memory, number of blocks allocated, size of max chunk in O(1) handling different cases and boundary conditions. For Size of largest and smallest chunk,  During my_alloc or my_free if there is modification in free node having size = largest or smallest chunk than I am updating largest and smallest chunk respectively by traversing through the whole linked list in O(n), Because in this case it would not be possible for us to determine the next largest or smallest chunk in O(1). If the change is in free node having free memory size not equal to size of smallest and largest chunk, than I am updating the respective variable in O(1).
